Hello there!

I visitied to Coorg/Madikeri in 2019, this place was really awsome especially the climate.
There are several activities and adventures in Coorg such as river rafting, Abbey Falls, Madikeri fort, etc..

While rafting, I was fell down from the raft. For a moment, it was a thrilling experience becuase, though I feared I managed 
to swim to the raft. People should really expereince river rafting.
